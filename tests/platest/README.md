PLA Test
========

Written by DaniÃ«l Mantione in April 2023

This program tests the functionality of the Commodore 64 PLA. The program uses
hardware on an EasyFlash 1CR cartridge to control the cartridge PLA signals.

This means that an EasyFlash 1CR cartridge needs to be inserted before running
this program. The cartridge can be in programming mode to boot to BASIC.
Flash ROM contents do not matter and won't be modified.
