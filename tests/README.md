C64 for MEGA65 Regression Testing
=================================

Before releasing a new version we strive to run all regression tests described
here. Since running through all the [demos](demos.md) takes some serious
effort, it might be that we are not always doing it.

Version 5 - Month Day, 2023
---------------------------

@TODO @TODO @TODO @TODO @TODO

Add "Reset and unmount prevention while writing to disk" and
"Change mount status while menu is closed (i.e. Smart Reset)" to "Additional Smoke Tests"

Add tests that stress the new menu system.

@TODO @TODO @TODO @TODO @TODO

Add the PLA test

Add a test for the mouse and the paddles

@REMOVE THIS FROM THE C64 tests documentation when done. This is just an
internal reminder for making sure that the MiSTer2MEGA65 framework release
that accompanies the release of the C64 core is rock solid:

Since the C64 core has the drive and the cartrige "above the fold" (i.e.
above any submenu), there might be some hidden bugs in the M2M framework that
only become visible when the drive/cartridge and other menu-modifying logic
happens "below the fold".

Therefore we need to use the M2M demo core: We need to perform some tests (and
thought experiments) to check: Are there any situations where the menu is
changed with direct coordinate calculations from outside of menu.asm and
therefore without the necessary transformation from flat coordinate space to
relative coordinate space.

Important is that we spend some time (re)searching for all the places and
situations in the code that print directly to the screen outside menu.asm vs.
just modifying the flat data structures.

In shell.asm, `_HM_SETMENU` might be a candidate that needs to be refactored.
From an architectural clarity perspective, menu.asm should be refactored to
encapsulate the necessary functionality so that shell.asm (and probably
options.asm, too) can access it and therefore things like the coordinate
transformation in `_OPTM_R_F2M` but also other semantic knowledge
are staying protected inside menu.asm.

Add tests for Cartridges (real ones and simulated ones) and other tests regarding new features/changes

### How to interpret the test results

We consider the pattern of success (:white_check_mark:) and failure (:x:) in
the [Demos](demos.md), the C64 Emulator Test suite and the dedicated REU tests
(scroll down, see below) as the baseline for Version 4 and therefore as
"success". Future versions must deliver the same - or better.

### Basic regression tests

#### Main menu

Work with the main menu and run software that allows to test the following:

* Mount disk
* Filebrowser
* Save configuration, switch off/switch, check configuration
* Flip joystick ports
* SID: 6581 and 8580
* REU: 1750 with 512KB
* HDMI : CRT emulation
* HDMI : Zoom-in
* HDMI : 16:9 50 Hz
* HDMI : 16:9 60 Hz
* HDMI :  4:3 50 Hz
* HDMI :  5:4 50 Hz
* HDMI : Flicker-free
* HDMI : DVI (no sound)
* VGA  : Retro 15Khz RGB
* CIA  : Use 8521 (C64C)
* Audio Improvements
* About and Help
* Close Menu

#### Additional Smoke Tests

* Try to mount disk while SD card is empty
* Work with both SD cards (and switch back and forth in file-browser)
* Remove external SD card while menu and file browser are not open;
  reinsert while file browser is open
* Work with large directory trees / game libraries
* Eagle's Nest: Reset-tests: Short reset leads to main screen. Long reset
  resets the whole core (not only the C64).
* Giana Sisters: Scrolling while flicker-free is ON/OFF, joystick, latency
* Katakis: High score saving/loading
* Smile to the Sky (demo): SID 8580 filters
* Sonic the Hedgehog: REU
* Space Lords: Support for 4 paddles

### C64 Emulator Test Suite V2.15

Tested with 6526 CIA. We consider the following test pattern, i.e. "Disc 1
Complete" and Disc 2 "everything works but the below-mentioned exceptions" as
"success" and our baseline for Release 4.

Same issue on MiSTer C64_20221117.rbf. Perfectly runs on real Commodore C64 with Ultimate Cartridge.

| :white_check_mark: | Sonic The Hedgehog v1.2+5                   | Joystick in port 2, choose options with ARROWS and RETURN, accept to load full game into the REU when asked
| :x:                | Creatures II +9Hi - Mystic                  | Impossible to load the game until the end. Same issues on MiSTer C64_20221117.rbf and real C64+Ultimate Cartridge.
| :white_check_mark: | Exterminator_1991_Audiogenic_(REU)          | 
| :white_check_mark: | from_the_west[r]                            | All is happening in REU (no disk access) but interraction is quite slow
| :white_check_mark: | Ski_or_Die_1990_Electronic_Arts_REU         | Joystick in port 2. Takes ages to load from disk to the REU on our core as well as on MiSTer and a real C64.
| :white_check_mark: | Walkerz +3                                  | Joystick in port 2
