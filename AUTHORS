Very special thanks to AmzokPhase101 for very patiently and with great
thoroughness performing a lot of tests plus the most intense "demo marathon"
series regression tests. The results of the "demo marathon" tests are
documented in tests/demos.md.

Special thanks for countless hours of testing, sparring, advise and other
valuable support (in alphabetical order): adtbm, deft & lydon

Special thanks to Daniel Mantione for helping us to support the EasyFlash 1CR

Special thanks to Thomas 'skoe' Giesel for helping us to support the
EasyFlash 3 and to the whole EasyFlash team (https://skoe.de/easyflash/aboutus/)
for creating this wonderful cartridge which became a movement

Special thanks to dbf for supporting us in navigating all questions related
to the MEGA65's PCB and its circuitry

Special thanks to sho3string for helping us to understand retro cathode ray
tube monitors and for writing the dedicated documentation doc/retrotubes.md

Special thanks to Adam Barnes for not only creating the most awesome Open
Source HDMI core on the planet (see below) but also for patiently sharing his
wisdom and tirelessly supporting us in improving our HyperRAM controller

Special thanks to Antti Lukats/Trenz Electronic for helping us to stabilize
our HyperRAM controller

Thanks to Carsten Elton Sørensen (csoren) for adding simulated cartridge
support (.crt) for COMAL 80, Simons BASIC, Waterloo Structured BASIC,
Mikro Assembler and BMP-Data Turbo 2000.
